[Best Practices and Docker Container Usage]

- [x] Create a new public repository on GitHub with a name of your choice.

- [x] Clone the repository on your personal computer. Never clone a repo inside a repo!

- [x] Setup container within your repository. Download and run setup.sh script from: https://github.com/rambasnet/course-container

- [x] Execute run.sh to start the Docker container. Use git-bash terminal if youâ€™re using Windows.

- [x] Use Docker extension of VS Code to attch the running container as a Terminal to run all the commands.

- [x] Solve Kattis problem Cosmic Path Optimization - https://open.kattis.com/problems/cosmicpathoptimization

- [x] Create an issue in GitHub stating the requirements using checkboxes.

- [x] Create and checkout branch: issue/<#> mapping each issue with a dedicated branch; where # is actual issue number, 1 e.g..

- [x] Solve the problem in a way that can be unit tested.

- [x] Must use atleast 1 fruitful function that needs to be tested with 6 test cases (6 separate test functions for each test case)

- [x] Write a separate test module and write test cases using unittest libray.

- [x] Create a Makefile inside the cosmicpathoptimization folder:

- [x] Add a rule for local unit test

- [x] Add a rule for local Kattis test on sample input/output files

- [x] Add a rule for checking styles using flake8

- [ ] Add a rule for fixing styles using autopep8

- [x] Add a rule for checking types with mypy

- [x] Add a rule to submit problem to Kattis using Kattis CLI

- [ ] Run make all to make sure all the checks and tests pass. Create screenshot of the final report of make all rule execution.

- [ ] Submit your solution to Kattis using Makefile and create screenshot of Accepted verdict result on your terminal.
